## nihilux publication

nihilux publication is a house of publication thought and built on open sources technologies and practices.

the idea is to bring devops cultural revolution outside of the IT space, especially in the cultural space.

technology is everywhere, but it seems to miss its first ambition to ease and lean human processes.

as, on one side, a published text is basically a source file with appropriate formatting, and, on the other side, review processes, based on any kind of workflow are now mature enough, it seems quite obvious to use git and integrated CI/CD tools to create a house of publication in 2020.

people behind nihilux publication strongly believe that organizing how is structured our collective memories is something fundamental for human societies.
 
we also hope that bringing a way to publish and share ideas, to discuss them and to create a collective agreement on them, **before** publication, could avoid lots of the mess introduced by social networks and the interwebs...  

for now, this is more a concept than a working organization. a kind of proof of concept.

anyone interested with this idea is welcome to share this interest...

have fun,

take care,

enjoy,
