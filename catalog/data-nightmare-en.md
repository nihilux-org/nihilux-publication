data is everywhere and have a huge impact on the way we build our representation of reality.

data is not a piece of truth, is not objective, it's a cultural construction and should be treated as a cultural construction.

as stated by the powerful analysis developped by [Shoshana Zuboff](https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/ "Shoshana Zoboff's website"){:target="_blank"}, data is now at the heart of oppressive structures of our societies.

creating collective knowledge and vocabulary around theses questions seems necessary in order to empower ourselves and our communities.

(it's a shame that the only published text is not translated yet, it takes time to set everything up...)
