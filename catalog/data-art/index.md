data is everywhere and have a huge impact on the way we build our representation of reality.

data is not a piece of truth, is not objective, it's a cultural construction and should be treated as a cultural construction.

art should help us to empower ourselves from data: retrieve our collective capacity to build collective representation without the need of this fake objectivity.
