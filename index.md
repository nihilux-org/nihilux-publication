## nihilux publication

nihilux publication is a house of publication thought and built on open sources technologies and practices.

the idea is to bring [**devops cultural revolution**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps "Wikipedia English article about DevOps"){:target="_blank"} outside of the IT space, especially in the cultural space.

technology is everywhere, but it seems to miss its first ambition to ease and lean human processes.

as, on one side, a published text is basically a source file with appropriate formatting, and, on the other side, review processes, based on any kind of workflow are now mature enough, it seems quite obvious to use git and integrated *[CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration "Wikipedia English article about Continuous Integration"){:target="_blank"}/[CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery "Wikipedia English article about Continuous Delivery"){:target="_blank"}* tools to create a house of publication in 2020.

people behind nihilux publication strongly believe that organizing how is structured our collective memories is something fundamental for human societies.
 
we also hope that bringing a way to publish and share ideas, to discuss them and to create a collective agreement on them, **before** publication, could avoid lots of the mess introduced by social networks and the interwebs...  

for now, this is more a concept than a working organization. a kind of proof of concept.

especially automatically built pdf and ePub are not yet published, nor are displayed the links to get them. it takes time to set everything up...

as [**nihilux** L.P.](https://nihilux.org "nihilux home page"){:target="_blank"} has been created in Qu√©bec, nihilux publication will publish everything in French, in English and in the language it has been written.

please excuse us for launching an English version only first, once again it takes time to set everything up...

you can have a look at a prototype of what could be **_[nihilux publication catalog](./catalog "nihilux publication catalog")_** (at least on how this could look).

anyone interested with this idea is welcome to share this interest...

have fun,

take care,

enjoy,

nihilux publication comitee
